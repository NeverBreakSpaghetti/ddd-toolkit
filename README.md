The `ddd-toolkit` library empowers developers to implement Domain-Driven Design (DDD) best practices for cleaner and more maintainable software. It provides production-ready implementations of core DDD tactical patterns like aggregates, domain events, read models, and repositories.

### Focus on your Domain: 

`ddd-toolkit` prioritizes simplicity and avoids unnecessary complexity. You won't need to deal with message brokers, eventual consistency, or asynchronous mechanisms at the outset. This streamlined approach makes it easier to adopt DDD practices and focus on your domain logic.

### Scalable Design:

The resulting design fosters a scalable architecture. You can introduce complexity gradually, only when necessary, ensuring your application grows smoothly alongside your business needs.

### Target Audience:

This library is ideal for developers who want to:

Get started with DDD principles.
Simplify DDD implementation in their projects.
Improve code maintainability and testability.
